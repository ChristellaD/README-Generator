# README-Generator
## Description
This README Generator is a command-line application that generates a professional README.md file based on user input. This project was an exercise in working with the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package. It uses the Inquirer package for user prompts and then creates markdown with sections for Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contribution, Testing, and Questions. This generator was built to provide users with a practical way to create README files quickly, making more time for coding! 
## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contribution](#contribution)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Install the required dependecies using 'npm i'.

## Usage
Execute the code in your terminal using node index.js.

You will be prompted with a series of questions about your project. After completing these questions, your README.md file will be generated and saved to the project directory.
